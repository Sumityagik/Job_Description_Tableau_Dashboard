# Job_Description_Tableau_Dashboard
This is the Tableau dashboard of Job_description dataset of world wide companies. It is the project of my one month Internship with NullClass EdTech pvt. ltd .

This project is part of my internship at **NULLCLASS**.  
It is a complete **interactive Tableau Dashboard** built using a synthetic **Job Descriptions Dataset** (`Job_descriptions.csv`).  

The dashboard provides powerful insights into **job market trends** by applying complex filters and visualizations across multiple tasks.
